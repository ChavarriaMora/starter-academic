role: Lecturer
avatar_filename: Avatar 2025.jpg
 bio: I'm a political science PhD candidate at the University of Pittsburgh and a lecturer at the University of Costa Rica, focusing on comparative political behavior with a regional focus on Latin America. My dissertation focuses on the use of social media for electoral campaigning by political parties in developing countries, particularly in Central America.  I have an MA from the University of Pittsburgh and received my undergraduate degrees from the University of Costa Rica. My broader research agenda has focused on protest politics, party competition, and ideology. Methods-wise, I am interested in the use of statistical and data science methods, including text as data, spatial and time-series econometrics, hierarchical models, and machine learning. My work has been published in Latin American, Spanish, and American journals, including Legislative Studies Quarterly and Latin American Politics and Society. \n I have worked on research projects at the Centro de Investigación y Estudio Políticos of the University of Costa Rica and at the Programa Estado de la Nación of the Consejo Nacional de Rectores of Costa Rica. I participated in the 2022 Summer Institute in Computational Social Science at Rutgers University, New Jersey. I also have done field research interviewing Costa Rican legislative assembly deputies in 2014 and 2022 for the Parliamentary Elites in Latin America Observatory of the University of Salamanca.

I'm a lecturer at the School of Political Science at the University of Costa Rica. I have a PhD in political science from the University of Pittsburgh. My research focuses on comparative political behavior, and regionally on Latin America. The topic of my dissertation is the use of social media for electoral campaigning by political parties in developing countries, particularly in Central America. My broader research agenda has focused on protest politics, party competition, and ideology. Methods-wise, I am interested in the use of statistical and data science methods, including text as data, spatial and time-series econometrics, hierarchical models, and machine learning. My work has been published in Latin American, Spanish, and American journals, including Social Media + Society, Legislative Studies Quarterly and Latin American Politics and Society. <br>
I have worked on research projects at the Centro de Investigación y Estudio Políticos of the University of Costa Rica and at the Programa Estado de la Nación of the Consejo Nacional de Rectores of Costa Rica.
